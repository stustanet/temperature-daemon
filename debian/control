Description: Tempermonitor sensor temperature reading deamon
 This is the StuStaNet Temperature Monitoring System.
 .
 # Hardware Setup and Protocol
 .
 The temperature sensors are ds18x20 sensors connected via the onewire protocol
 to an esp32. The esp is connected via usb-serial to the host computer.
 This sends roughly every second a measurement value from one of the sensors.
 After a complete round it sends an empty line.
 .
 # Dependencies
 .
 pyserial-asyncio. And >=python3.5.
 .
 # Architecture
 The communications is done within the temperature_daemon.py file as well as
 error handling for the sensor measurements.
 It will then call functions in plugins to do the majority of the work.
 .
 The plugins are located in the `plugins` folder.
